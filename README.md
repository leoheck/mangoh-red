# MangOH Red

[MangOH Red](https://mangoh.io/mangoh-red-resources) board was build using Mentor DxDesigner for schematics and Pantheon PCB for layouts. This project aims to build a version using the GREAT [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) and [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) with [StepUp](http://kicad-pcb.org/external-tools/stepup/) plugin for Kicad.

_This project is a work in progress._
